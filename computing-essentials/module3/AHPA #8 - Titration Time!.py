# AHPA #8 - Titration Time!
# 
# You are a Chemistry major who has to create 
# a program for first time Chem lab users.
#
# The Erlenmeyer flask contains a nitric acid 
# solution.
#
# When the student presses a button, a 0.5 ml 
# NaOH solution can be added to a buret, which 
# is set up over the Erlenmeyer flask.
# 
# An indicator is added to the solution being 
# titrated. The indicator is a substance that 
# changes to blue when the reaction is 
# complete (endpoint).	 You determine the 
# amount of mixture that will cause this 
# reaction to occur.
# 
# Create a titration simulator that will allow 
# a student to add up to 18 ml of titrant. 
# 
# Notify the student when the mixture turns 
# blue.
