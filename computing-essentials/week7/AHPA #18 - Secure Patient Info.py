# AHPA #18 - Secure Patient Info

# Write a program that asks a user to
# enter the password in order to access 
# the data.
#
# If the password is entered 
# incorrectly 3 times in a row, raise a 
# ValueError exception and inform the 
# user that they are now locked out.
#
# If the password is correctly entered, 
# open the data file, parse the 
# records, and on separate lines print 
# the patientâ€™s name (First, Middle, 
# Last) and their SS# with NO blank 
# lines between each line.
